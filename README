readUntangler:
Inputs: consensus genome (fasta) and raw sequencing reads (fastq)
Process: maps reads to genome using bwa, calls variants using freebayes, haplotypes with hapcut,
then a python script is used to generate the two haplotyped sequences

Haplotype results are best when using pacbio or other long reads.  For pacbio data, as of 2013
there was no convenient way of getting fastq files.  I manually injected fake quality scores for
all reads and used that as the input.  Comparison of results with manual haplotyping of 28kb showed
an agreement of ~99%; disagreements were often ambiguous or manual errors. 

Dependencies:

This script assumes you have samtools and bwa installed and available in your path.

Other requirements:
The freebayes binary should be copied into the binaries directory and renamed "freebayes.binary"
Freebayes is available here: https://github.com/ekg/freebayes

Hapcut and associated binaries are available here: https://sites.google.com/site/vibansal/software/hapcut
readUntangler was used with hapcut v0.5.  Newer versions have not been tested,
but please let me know if you run into any problems.
The HAPCUT and extractHAIRS binaries should also be placed in the binaries directory.
