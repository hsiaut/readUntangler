readUntangler:
Inputs: consensus genome (fasta) and sequencing reads (fastq)
Process: maps reads to genome using bwa, calls variants using freebayes, haplotypes with hapcut, then a python script is used to generate the two haplotyped sequences


Dependencies:

This script assumes you have samtools and bwa installed and available in your path.

Other requirements:
The freebayes binary should be copied into the binaries directory and renamed "freebayes.binary"
Freebayes is available here: https://github.com/ekg/freebayes

Hapcut and associated binaries are available here: https://sites.google.com/site/vibansal/software/hapcut
readUntangler was used with hapcut v0.5.  Newer versions have not been tested, but please let me know if you run into any problems.
The HAPCUT and extractHAIRS binaries should also be placed in the binaries directory.
